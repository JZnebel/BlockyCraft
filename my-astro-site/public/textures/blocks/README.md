# Minecraft Block Textures

This directory will contain Minecraft block textures.

For now, we'll use solid colors that match Minecraft block colors.
In the future, actual texture files can be added here.

Textures should be 16x16 PNG files named after their block type:
- stone.png
- dirt.png
- grass_block_top.png
- oak_planks.png
- etc.
